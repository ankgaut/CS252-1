 Make the server persistent, such that it doesn’t quit after one message transfer
– Redesign the server such that it accepts inputs from the client, transforms them into lowercase
and transmits back
– Redesign the server and client such that
– The client requests an HTML file from the server that is displaying some headers and a simple table
– The server reads the file stored in the server’s computer and transmits it as text to the client
– Write a shell script that will display the corresponding webpage on the client’s computer
– Create a version of the server that will allow connectionless (UDP) transfer
● Client code will have to change too
● See if you can get the HTML transfer to work for this UDP connection also
– Create a version of the TCP server that will permit concurrent connections from multiple clients
